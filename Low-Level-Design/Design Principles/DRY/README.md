# Dry Principle

1. Don't Repeat Yourself
2. Avoid Duplication
3. Reusable components, functions, and modules
4. More maintainable code
5. Reduces chances of errors
6. Related to concepts of Modular programming(creation of functions, classes, modules for encapsulation)
7. the Single Responsibility Principle, is often mentioned in conjunction with DRY

# Approaches
1. Created methods for repeated logic
2. Use classes and inheritance
3. Extract constants or configurations(centralize the common constants to avoid redundancy)
4. Modularization: code into modular components

# Key Features
1. Code Reusability
2. Maintenance and Updates
3. Readability
4. Consistency
