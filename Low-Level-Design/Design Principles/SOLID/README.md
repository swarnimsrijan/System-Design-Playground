# SOLID Principle

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The SOLID principles are:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – A class should have only one reason to change.
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) – Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
